# Classic Chess Game

Hello! This is a fun chess game you can play. It has many cool things to make your game awesome. You can play with friends, try to beat the computer, or pretend to play online. You can also change how the game looks!

## How to Play (What You Can Do)

*   **Normal Chess Rules:** You play chess like you normally would.
    *   If your little pawn piece reaches the other side, it can become a Queen or other strong piece!
    *   Your King can do a special move called "castling" to get safe.
    *   There's a special pawn move called "en passant."
*   **Correct Moves Only:** The game makes sure you only make moves that are allowed in chess.
*   **How the Game Ends:** The game knows when it's over:
    *   **Checkmate:** When one player traps the other player's King, they win!
    *   **Stalemate:** Sometimes, no one can win, and it's a tie (draw).
*   **King in Danger!:** If your King is in trouble (in "check"), the game will show you.

## Ways to Play

*   **Play with a Friend (On One Computer):** Two people can play against each other using the same computer.
*   **Play Against the Computer (AI):** You can play a game against the computer.
    *   It uses a smart brain (Gemini AI) to play well if you have a special key for it.
    *   If not, it still plays, but with simpler moves.
*   **Play Online (Pretend):**
    *   You can make a special Game ID to share with a friend.
    *   Your friend can use this ID to join your game.
    *   *Good to know: This isn't real internet play. It uses your computer's memory. So, two people can play on the same computer (maybe in different web browser windows) or on computers close by.*

## Make It Look Your Way!

*   **Player Names:** You can type in names for Player 1 and Player 2.
*   **Light or Dark Look:** You can change the whole game to look light or dark.
*   **Change How Things Look:**
    *   **Board Style:** Pick different looks for the chessboard, like woody, blue, or green.
    *   **Piece Colors:** Choose different colors for the white and black chess pieces, like red, yellow, or blue.
    *   There's a special pop-up window where you can see and pick these looks.

## Using the Game (How It Feels)

*   **Click to Move:** Click on a chess piece, then click where you want it to go.
*   **See Where You Can Go:** When you pick a piece, the game shows you all the places it can move.
*   **See Taken Pieces:** It clearly shows which pieces each player has taken from the other.
*   **Whose Turn?:** It tells you who should play next.
*   **Game Messages:** It shows messages like "Your turn to play," "Watch out, King is in check!" or "You win!"
*   **Pawn Gets a New Job:** When a pawn gets to the end of the board, a box pops up so you can choose a new, stronger piece for it.
*   **Start Screen:** A nice screen at the beginning to help you choose how you want to play or see who the top players are.
*   **Works on Any Screen:** The game looks good and works well on big computer screens and small phone screens.

## Manage Your Games

*   **Game Menu:** A menu button to find different game options.
*   **Save & Load Games:**
    *   You can save your game if you want to stop and play later.
    *   You can load a game you saved before.
    *   You can delete saved games you don't want anymore.
*   **Top Players (Hall of Fame):**
    *   Keeps a list of winners from games played with friends or against the computer.
    *   Shows who won, who they played against, and when.
    *   You can clear this list if you want.
*   **New Game:** You can easily start a new game or go back to the main start screen.

## A Little About How It's Made

*   It's made with common tools for websites (React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS).
*   It uses your computer's memory (localStorage) to remember your settings, saved games, and top players.

Have fun playing chess!
